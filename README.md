# Personal Project :Full-Stack Todo-List-app

Create by: Zhixiang Yan

The Full-Stack ToDo List App is a web application that helps users manage their tasks and to-do items efficiently.
The app is developed using a combination of Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database.
It provides a seamless user experience for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks, allowing users to stay organized and productive.

## Features

User Authentication and Registration:

Users can log in to the app using their credentials. User authentication ensures that each user has a personalized experience.
Task Management:

Users can create, view, update, and delete tasks.
Each task has attributes such as description, due date, and status (completed or not).


Users can edit existing tasks, modifying attributes like description, and due date.
Task Deletion:

Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
Task Status Update:

Users can mark tasks as completed or change their status to reflect progress.
Database Interaction:

The app uses PostgreSQL as its database to store task data securely.
CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are performed on the database using Spring Boot's RESTful APIs.
Backend Development:

The backend is developed using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework.
RESTful APIs are created to handle incoming requests for CRUD operations on tasks.
Frontend Development:

The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React components are used to create a dynamic and responsive user interface.
API Communication:

The frontend communicates with the backend through HTTP requests, fetching and sending data to the server.
User Experience:

The app provides a smooth and intuitive user experience, with real-time updates and interactive features.
